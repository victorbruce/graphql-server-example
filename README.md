# GraphQL Server Example

Creating an Apollo Server through GraphQL and testing it using the Apollo Sandbox.

## What I've Learnt
- How to set up a GraphQL server and run it locally.
- How write queries to get a response on the frontend using **Apollo Sandbox**
- Create type definitions to describe data on a graph(schemas) and also specify entry points to the graph.
- Create resolver functions to decide how to respond to queries(either single or all) to a graph.
- Perform mutations(add, update, and delete) data.

## How to Run the Project
- After clonning, run the command: `npm install` then,
- Run the command: `npm start`
