# GraphQL Server Example

Creating an Apollo Server through GraphQL and testing it using the Apollo Sandbox.

## What I've Learnt
- Set up a server, run an apollo server locally, and test the server by querying for response using **Apollo Sandbox**.
- Create type definitions to describe data on a graph(schemas) and also specify entry points to the graph.
- Create resolver functions to decide how to respond to queries(either single or all) to a graph.

## How to Run the Project

Run the command: `npm start`
